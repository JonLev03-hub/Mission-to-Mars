# Mission-to-Mars


## Overview
The goal of this project was to design a website that would scrape data from multiple websites to compile a page that gives data on mars. In this project I had used flask to create the web application, bootstrap for some visual effects, and for the datascraping I used beautiful soup and splinter.

To host this website you need to run the app.py file, and then the website will be run. Use the scrape button in the center of the website to generate new mars data that is up to date.
